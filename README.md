# Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis Dashboard
### Problem Statement

The client, a retail store, struggled to identify which products, regions, and discounts were driving losses. Although overall sales looked strong, profit margins were inconsistent, and decision-makers lacked visibility into performance trends.

The goal was to build a data-driven dashboard that would:

Track Main KPI Keys: (Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, Loss %)

Identify loss-making products, regions, and categories

Show the impact of discounts on profitability

Provide actionable recommendations for business growth

## Approach

* Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized columns

* Added a Loss Flag column for orders with negative profit

### SQL Queries

Aggregated profit/loss by Category, Region, and Product

Analyzed discount distribution for profitable vs. loss orders

### Excel Analysis

Verified totals with pivot tables

Calculated KPIs like Profit Margin %, Loss %, and AOV (Average Order Value)

### Power BI Dashboard

KPI Cards: Total Sales (2.30M), Profit (286K), Loss % (6.8%), Avg Profit Margin (12%)

**Category Analysis:** Furniture had highest losses (-70K) while Technology was most profitable

**Regional/Geographic Analysis:** Losses concentrated in Philadelphia, Houston, and Chicago

**Discount Analysis:** Loss orders had an average discount of 48%, while profitable orders averaged much lower

## Key Insights

Furniture category contributed the highest losses due to heavy discounting.

West region performed well, while some cities (Philadelphia, Houston) consistently showed negative profits.

High discounts directly correlated with losses → nearly half of discounted orders resulted in negative profit.

## Recommendations

Reduce excessive discounting in Furniture and Office Supplies → even a 10% reduction could significantly improve margins.

Focus on Technology category as it drives majority of profits → invest in marketing here.

Re-evaluate unprofitable cities → consider adjusting logistics, pricing, or promotions.

Implement dynamic discount rules → avoid blanket discounts that lead to losses.

## Impact

This dashboard provides a clear view of sales vs. profitability, helping business leaders:

Identify where the business is losing money

Take data-driven pricing and discounting decisions

Monitor KPIs in real-time for smarter strategy
